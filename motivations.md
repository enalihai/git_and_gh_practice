I woke up every morning and hated what I had to do. For a decade of my life I worked for the Auto Industry. I missed countless trips and events because if you miss one day, it will effect your income for the entire month. Working Christmas day while others were with family and friends. It was when I looked up and realized that even when I turn 55, I will still be working Saturday morning 9am - 9 pm. That was it for me. I love computers. Always had. Before, I  would tell myself that I missed my calling. Now I know that life isn't a train track. It is more of a trail. I was focusing too much on the end. I need to be enjoying the path. Journey before Destination.
